   *	Completely New Backend.  
         *   More secure and robust against threats near and far.

   * Completely scalable cloud architecture! (Shiny!)

        *	The more instances of SA10 that are added, the more the system automatically scales and allocates processing power on the servers.
   *	New Registration experience for the new SA10!
   *	TOU now has text for dedicated BPS kiosks – Relates SE-1316
   *	Bolded cost and time values in rate card details for TOU so it’s more obvious how much time, service, or other benefits/services are being charged for.
