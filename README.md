## SA10 V3.1
*	### Platform
    *	Fully Configurable in Salesforce!! - A first in Uniguest History!  ![Jonah Hill Screaming](JonahHillScreaming.gif)
        *	  Manage Assets remotely from the platform you all know and love.
        *	  Update fleets in bulk with respect to Flag, Brand, and Location.
        *	  Make minute changes to individual assets.
        *   Reference assets in cases to make reporting and tracking escalations easier

        ![Blink Blink](BlinkBlink.gif)
   *	Completely New Backend.  
         *   More secure and robust against threats near and far.
   *	All endpoints require a subscription key to accept a request from the client! Not just anyone can send requests to the backend now, you’ve got to be on the list!  
   * Completely scalable cloud architecture! (Shiny!) 
        *	The more instances of SA10 that are added, the more the system automatically scales and allocates processing power on the servers.
   *	New Registration experience for the new SA10!
   *	TOU now has text for dedicated BPS kiosks – Relates SE-1316
   *	Bolded cost and time values in rate card details for TOU so it’s more obvious how much time, service, or other benefits/services are being charged for.
         
         ![Duh](Duh!.gif)

   * Session Details are now organized by date/time rather than First In last out order  



*	### Windows Client
    *	Added Serial Number to the help window.
    *	Override for Printer Name, if it’s just a B&W printer, we won’t charge for color prints!


*	### Mac Client
    *	Support for Deepfreeze included in 10.14.
