# Welcome to the Product Place! 
This site will serve to give you information about the suite of products sold, supported by, and developed within Uniguest.

## What?
The Product Place contains information on what the Product Team is working on, as well as why. We wanted to created a single place you can go to to answer general questions, review what each product does and why we provide it, and also to give you a laugh every now and again.

## Why
Product people are interested in the what and why of business. We aim to solve problems, within the context of the business. We saw an opportunity to create a cross departmental knowledge base about our products that anyone can visit to get an idea of the "what" and "why" of any particular product. 

### Navigation
You can use the top navigation to switch between the major product categories. 
Each product will have it's own navigation that contains overview, release notes, FAQs, and anything else applicable to that product. 

### Updates
The Product Place will be updated on a monthly basis in line with software releases and sprint endings. This site is not a replacement for internal documentation, knowledge bases, or any other processess you currently maintain. 

#### A note about tone
The Product Place aims to strike a balance between informative, and entertaining. Our main goal for this site is to provide the information you need to be successful, our secondary goal is to make it at least bearable and maybe even interesting to read!
